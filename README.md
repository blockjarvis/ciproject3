# GAME BARGAINS

![Mockup](static/images/readme/responsive.png)

This comprehensive site was designed for a bargain site. The focus of the site is to provide a functional bargain site with a clean and modern design.

This is the third of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute.

The main requirements were to make a responsive website that users can share their own data with the community and benefit from having convenient 
access to the data provided by all other members, create the back-end code and front-end form(s) to allow users to add new bargains to the site, 
edit them and delete them.

### Issues
- Some commands for MongoDB used on lessons were Deprecated, for instance, update() and remove().
- Had an issue with Procfile during the deployment to Heroku, file was saved as UTF-16, changed to UTF-8 to fix it.
- Using a javascript for confirmation button when deleting something. The script was deleting the wrong item, as when the pop-up was created the cache was lost. Had to properly identify the item by ID.

### Known Bugs

- On old devices, the images can break the layout.
- Cards and collapsible layout can break depending of text size.

### Future Improvements

- Select Bargains by category.
- Sort bargains by date.

## Deployment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code Insiders, committed to git and pushed to GitHub using git bash terminal.

### Deployment to Heroku

The live link can be found here - https://game-bargain.herokuapp.com/

### Deploying on Heroku

The website was deployed to heroku by doing the following:

1. Navigate to heroku.

2. Click "new" and create a new App.

3. Give your app a name, choose your region and Click "Create app".

4. The menus that we are concerned with are "Deploy" and "Settings". Click on "Settings" First.

5. Buildpacks now need to be added. These install future dependancies that we need outside of the requirements file. The first is python and the second is node.js. Select Python first and then node.js and click save. Make sure they are in this order.

6. Then go to the deploy section and choose your deployment method. To connect with github select github and confirm.

7. Search for your repo, select it and click connect.

8. You can choose to either deploy using automatic deploys which means heroku will rebuild the app everytime you push your changes. For this option choose the branch to deploy and click enable automatic deploys. This can be changed at a later date to manual. Manual deployment deploys the current state of a branch.

9. Click deploy branch.

If successful you should be able to view your deployed app by clicking "View".

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
